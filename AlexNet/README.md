## Paper 

This paper was particularly important to popularize deep learning and to push further the research interest in this field. 
The set of achievements described in the paper goes much beyond a simple performance improvement on the ImageNet dataset
and respective competition. The paper also proved that it is possible to go deeper, to build more complex models and increase the performance of previous models or architectures. To do that, for the first time, some new techniques were used together to improve the capability of the model. 

This is not only a nice paper with an even nicer architecture and results, but it also is a landmark in the history of deep learning.
