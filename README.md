# Popular-Deep-Nets-Architectures-Pytorch

This repository intends to aggregate implementation of deep neural networks described on popular papers. These networks became not only popular but also a mark in the deep learning history and development. It is a required knowledge for any deep learning researcher or practitioner because most of them were also pioneers in some advance in the field.
