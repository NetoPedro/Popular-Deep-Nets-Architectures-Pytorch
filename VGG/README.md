## Paper 

This paper, authored by Oxford researchers, presents an architecture, not good enough to win the ImageNet competition, 
although with extremely interesting details and scientific considerations that inspired future work. Therefore it is 
one of the most popular and influential papers in Deep Learning growth as a research field.

It is shown also a major performance improvement when compared to the 2-years older AlexNet, the network that 
popularized Deep Learning.
